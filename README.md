# VideoView

## Introduction

VideoView class is a visual component which provides many display options by loading images from various sources and by taking care of computing images measurement from the video. In other words, whenever we want to play a video file in any Android Activity, the very first thing that we consider is ‘Android VideoView’ class. When we add this component to the layout of an activity, a surface to play a video is provided. 
However, this component does not save the current play state and position. To do that, two major components used are onSaveInstanceState(Bundle) and onRestoreInstanceState(Bundle).
